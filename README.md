By inviting Botveon or using its features, you are agreeing to the below-mentioned **Terms of Service** and **Privacy Policy**. If you break or do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or adding Botveon to your server.

## Liability
The owner of Botveon may not be held liable for individuals breaking these Terms at any given time. The owner trusts that end users will be truthful and will not misuse Botveon or the services of Discord in a malicious way.

## Terms of Service

- Do not intentionally spam commands.
- Do not add or use Botveon in bot spam servers.
- Do not exploit a detected bug; instead, report it to our [support server](https://discord.gg/P3x9xtgFRH).
- The creator(s) of Botveon reserve the right to prohibit any server or user from using Botveon for any reason and without prior notice, even if the user isn't directly violating our Terms.
- The creator(s) of Botveon have the right to update the Terms of Service/Privacy Policy at any time with notice in the support server.

## Privacy Policy
### Temporarily stored data:
Botveon makes use of the Discord.js Node.js module, which automatically caches user data. However, this will **NOT** be stored permanently and gets deleted every couple of days/weeks.


### Permanent stored data:
- Member IDs
- Member roles
- Member amount of messages sent
- Member amount of commands used
- Member join dates
- Reactions on messages
- Amount of votes on top.GG
- Date of the most recent vote on top.GG
- Guild IDs
- Guild roles
- Guild channels

### Why do we keep this data?
First and foremost, we prioritize user privacy and only store essential data necessary for the functionality of Botveon. Botveon wouldn't be able to operate as intended without this data.

### How long do we store this data?
Data is stored permanently unless a member or server owner manually removes it, or Botveon is kicked from your server.

### How can I get my data deleted?
- Members can run the command `/account data delete` to delete their data on all servers.
- Server owners can run the command `/config-reset server` to delete all data of the guild and member-profiles within that guild. 
- Kicking Botveon will automatically delete all data of the guild and member-profiles within that guild when the bot is restarted. 

Please note that these commands are irreversible, and once data is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

### Do we share data?
No, Botveon does not sell or share user data with third parties. User data is only used strictly for its own functionality and the (future) website.
